                                       remain identifiable, when used elsewhere, for instance in the

                        <p>The /tm/ folder can contain any number of ancillary
                                       translation memories - i.e. tmx files. Such files can be created
                                       in any of the three varieties indicated above. Note that other CAT
                                       tools can export (and import as well) tmx files, usually in all
                                       three forms. The best thing of course is to use OmegaT-specific
                                       TMX files (see above), so that the in-line formatting within the
                                       segment is retained.
                        </p>
                        <p>The contents of translation memories in the tm subfolder
                                       serve to generate suggestions for the text(s) to be translated.
                                       Any text, already translated and stored in those files, will
                                       appear among the fuzzy matches, if it is sufficiently similar to
                                       the text currently being translated.
                        </p>
                        <p>If the source segment in one of the ancillary TMs is
                                       identical to the text being translated, OmegaT acts as defined in
                                       the <span class="guimenu">Options</span> → <span class="guimenuitem">Editing Behavior...</span> dialog window. For instance (if the default is
                                       accepted), the translation from the ancillary TM is accepted and
                                       prefixed with<span class="emphasis"><em> [fuzzy]</em></span>, so that the translator
                                       can review the translations at a later stage and check whether the
                                       segments tagged this way, have been translated correctly (see the
                                       <a class="link" href="chapter.translation.editing.html" title="Chapter&nbsp;10.&nbsp;Editing behavior">Editing

                        <p>It may happen, that translation memories, available in the
                                       <code class="filename">tm</code> subfolder, contain segments with identical
                                       source text, but differing targets. TMX files are read sorted by
                                       their names and segments within a given TMX file line by line. The
                                       last segment with the identical source text will thus prevail
                                       (Note: of course it makes more sense to avoid this to happen in
                                       the first place).

                        <p>Note that the TMX files in the tm folder can be compressed

                                       matter, client, revision status, etc., less reliable. For
                                       translation memories in folders with a name "penalty-xxx" (with
                                       xxx between 0 and 100), matches will be degraded according to the
                                       name of the folder: a 100% match in any of TMs, residing in a
                                       folder called Penalty-30 for instance, will be lowered to a 70%
                                       match. The penalty applies to all three match percentages: matches
                                       75, 80, 90 will in this case be lowered to 45, 50, 60.

               <p>Note that all the translation memories are loaded into memory when

                        project is closed or loaded again. This means for instance that you do
                        not need to exit a project you are currently working on if you decide to
                        add another ancillary TM to it: you simply reload the project, and the
                        changes you have made will be included.

               <p>The locations of the various different translation memories for a

                        them as the source and target segments respectively. OmegaT recognizes
                        the language codes using the following two standard conventions :

            <p>Initially, that is when the project is created, the main TM of the
                   project, <code class="filename">project_save.tmx</code> is empty. This TM gradually
                   becomes filled during the translation. To speed up this process, existing
                   translations can be reused. If a given sentence has already been
                   translated once, and translated correctly, there is no need for it to be
                   retranslated. Translation memories may also contain reference
                   translations: multinational legislation, such as that of the European
                   Community, is a typical example.
            </p>
            <p>When you create the target documents in an
                   <span class="application">OmegaT</span> project, the translation memory of the
                   project is output in the form of three files in the root folder of your
                   <span class="application">OmegaT</span> project (see the above description). You
                   can regard these three tmx files (<code class="filename">-omegat.tmx</code>,
                   <code class="filename">-level1.tmx</code> and <code class="filename">-level2.tmx</code>) as
                   an "export translation memory", i.e. as an export of your current
                   project's content in bilingual form.
            </p>
            <p>Should you wish to reuse a translation memory from a previous
                   project (for example because the new project is similar to the previous
                   project, or uses terminology which might have been used before), you can
                   use these translation memories as "input translation memories", i.e. for
                   import into your new project. In this case, place the translation memories
                   you wish to use in the <span class="emphasis"><em>/tm</em></span> or
                   <span class="emphasis"><em>/tm</em></span>/auto folder of your new project: in the former
                   case you will get hits from these translation memories in the fuzzy
                   matches viewer, and in the latter case these TMs will be used to
                   pre-translate your source text.
            </p>
            <p>By default, the /tm folder is below the project's root folder (e.g.
                   ...<span class="emphasis"><em>/MyProject/tm</em></span>), but you can choose a different
                   folder in the project properties dialog if you wish. This is useful if you
                   frequently use translation memories produced in the past, for example
                   because they are on the same subject or for the same customer. In this
                   case, a useful procedure would be:

               <p>OmegaT supports imported tmx versions 1.1-1.4b (both level 1 and
                        level 2). This enables the translation memories produced by other tools
                        to be read by OmegaT. However, OmegaT does not fully support imported
                        level 2 tmx files (these store not only the translation, but also the
                        formatting). Level 2 tmx files will still be imported and their textual
                        content can be seen in OmegaT, but the quality of fuzzy matches will be
                        somewhat lower.
               </p>
               <p>OmegaT follows very strict procedures when loading translation
                        memory (tmx) files. If an error is found in such a file, OmegaT will
                        indicate the position within the defective file at which the error is
                        located.
               </p>
               <p>Some tools are known to produce invalid tmx files under certain
                        conditions. If you wish to use such files as reference translations in
                        OmegaT, they must be repaired, or OmegaT will report an error and fail
                        to load them. Fixes are trivial operations and OmegaT assists
                        troubleshooting with the related error message. You can ask the user
                        group for advice if you have problems.
               </p>
               <p>OmegaT exports version 1.4 TMX files (both level 1 and level 2).
                        The level 2 export is not fully compliant with the level 2 standard, but
                        is sufficiently close and will generate correct matches in other
                        translation memory tools supporting TMX Level 2. If you only need
                        textual information (and not formatting information), use the level 1
                        file that OmegaT has created.

               <p>There may be cases where you have done a project with e.g. Dutch
                        sources, and a translation in say English. Then you need a translation
                        in e.g. Chinese, but your translator does not understand Dutch; she,
                        however, understands perfectly English. In this case, the NL-EN
                        translation memory can serve as a go-between to help generate NL to ZH
                        translation.
               </p>
               <p>The solution in our example is to copy the existing translation
                        memory into the tm/tmx2source/ subfolder and rename it to ZH_CN.tmx to
                        indicate the target language of the tmx. The translator will be shown
                        English translations for source segments in Dutch and use them to create
                        the Chinese translation.
               </p>
               <p><span class="bold"><strong>Important: </strong></span>the supporting TMX
                        must be renamed XX_YY.tmx, where XX_YY is the target language of the
                        tmx, for instance to ZH_CN.tmx in the example above. The project and TMX
                        source languages should of course be identical - NL in our example. Note
                        that only one TMX for a given language pair is possible, so if several
                        translation memories should be involved, you will need to merge them all
                        into the XX_YY.tmx.

                   in case the same source segment exists, but with a target text. The result

                   penalty applied to the alternative translation (i.e., a 100% match becomes
                   an 80% match). The word [Fuzzy] is displayed on the source segment.

            <p>When you load a segmented TTX file, segments with source = target
                   will be included, if "Allow translation to be equal to source" in Options
                   → Editing Behavior... has been checked. This may be confusing, so you may
                   consider unchecking this option in this case.

            <p>Before segments get translated, you may wish to pre-process them or
                   address them in some other way than is possible with OmegaT. For example,
                   if you wish to create a pseudo-translation for testing purposes, OmegaT
                   enables you to create an additional tmx file that contains all segments of
                   the project. The translation in this tmx can be either

                     <p>translation equals source (default)</p>

                  </li>
               </ul>
            </div>
            <p>The tmx file can be given any name you specify. A pseudo-translated
                   memory can be generated with the following command line parameters:
            </p>
            <p><code class="literal">java -jar omegat.jar --pseudotranslatetmx=&lt;filename&gt;
                      [pseudotranslatetype=[equal|empty]]</code></p>
            <p>Replace <code class="literal">&lt;filename&gt;</code> with the name of the
                   file you wish to create, either absolute or relative to the working folder
                   (the folder you start <span class="application">OmegaT</span> from). The second
                   argument <code class="literal">--pseudotranslatetype</code> is optional. Its value
                   is either <code class="literal">equal</code> (default value, for source=target) or
                   <code class="literal">empty</code> (target segment is empty). You can process the
                   generated tmx with any tool you want. To reuse it in
                   <span class="application">OmegaT</span> rename it to <span class="emphasis"><em>project_save.tmx
                         </em></span> and place it in the <code class="literal">omegat</code>-folder of your

            <p>Very early versions of <span class="application">OmegaT</span> were
                   capable of segmenting source files into paragraphs only and were
                   inconsistent when numbering formatting tags in HTML and Open Document
                   files. <span class="application">OmegaT</span> can detect and upgrade such tmx
                   files on the fly to increase fuzzy matching quality and leverage your
                   existing translation better, saving you the work of doing this
                   manually.
            </p>
            <p>A project's tmx will be upgraded only once, and will be written in
                   upgraded form into the <code class="filename">project-save.tmx</code>; legacy tmx
                   files will be upgraded on the fly each time the project is loaded. Note
                   that in some cases changes in file filters in
                   <span class="application">OmegaT</span> may lead to totally different
                   segmentation; as a result, you will have to upgrade your translation
                   manually in such rare cases.
